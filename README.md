# starwars-market-sim
different wrapper on a more “marketable” project: stock market simulation. Sith and Jedi are like buyers and sellers, planets are commodities, and generals are stock market traders!

movie watcher modes (where command line flag -w is entered) represents streaming algorithim:
"...where we can only look at each input once, and cannot make a copy of all the input. This is similar to a stock market simulation also, where if we could go back in time, we could determine the optimal point at which to buy and then later sell the same commodity (planet) to achieve the highest profit margin."
